## General Information
Lending club finance company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. <br>

There are few factors considered for decission making:

- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). <br>
- Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.<br>
- Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.<br>

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Technologies Used
Python3 and below pyhton libraries -
- pandas: Used for dataframe comuptations
- numpy: For mathematical operations
- datetime: This package is used to extract Month and Year where ever required  
- matplotlib: Used for visualizations
- seaborn: Used for visualizations


<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
DrivingFactors(or driver variables):
- Grade: Default Rate is high in high-risk loan applicants. It would be important for Lending Club to thoroughly vet high risk loan applications.
- Annual Income: Applicants from 'Low'(<=45K USD) and 'Medium'(45K-90K USD) income group have a greater share of defaulted loans.
- Employment Length: Maximum number of defaulters have 10/10+ years of experience and 0 to 2 years of experience. Hence, Lending Club should be taking this aspect into consideration while lending loans.
- Loan Purpose: The top two reasons for loans are debt consolidation and credit card. Such applications should be carefully assessed.
